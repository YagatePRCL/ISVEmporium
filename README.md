# **README FOR BEST ISV'S**

**ISVEmporium is still in BETA. Using older versions may or may not work when loading older or newer craft.**

Disclaimer: ISV Emporium is not associated with Patch Emporium, however if using FFT, we recommend it.

## ISV Emporium is a collection of +part configs to add missing, or otherwise scaled parts to part mods that don't include them.

### Required mods:
- Heat Control (Adds Long Radiator Support): https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/HeatControl
- Near Future Construction (Adds Long Truss Support) : https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/NearFutureConstruction

### Optional mods:
- Sigma Loading Screens: https://github.com/Sigma88/Sigma-LoadingScreens (adds wickedly cool loading screens with ISV's)

### INSTALLATION:

Drag and drop the folder inside the extracted ISVEmporium called ISVEmporium inside Gamedata, into your actual KSP Gamedata

## ‚ùå **KNOWN ISSUES** 
- Tweakscale may limit the parts rescale sizes depending on which version of tweakscale you have. (This is due to old mods like KSPIE, It's recommended you uninstall them if using tweakscale on these parts)
- Mass is incorrectly calculated (tbe patches don't have mass configs yet, I will write them eventaully.) For now they're there for purely for screenshots.
- Graphene radiators dont scale heat with tweakscale (yet another tweakscale issue that is not my fault) This is an issue with heat control graphene radiators only. I plan to add more radiators like the high heat ones. I should be able to adjust the heat scaling on those, but for the graphene radiators, they don't work, regardless of what tweakscale version you use, or this mod which add scaled versions of them.

## üëé **Incompatibilities**
- (KSPIE/KSPI) When using Tweakscale on ISVEmporium parts with KSPIE/KSPI installed (Or any older mod), ISVEmporium parts will not scale beyond 40 meters.
