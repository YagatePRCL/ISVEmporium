Disclaimer: ISV Emporium is not associated with Patch Emporium, however if using FFT, we recommend it.

ISV Emporium is a collection of +part configs to add missing, or otherwise scaled parts to part mods that don't include them.

Required mods:
Heat Control (Adds Long Radiator Support)
Near Future Construciton (Adds Long Truss Support)

INSTALLATION:

Drag and drop ISVEmporium into KSP Gamedata
For modularity, delete the labeled folders if you do not want certain parts.
