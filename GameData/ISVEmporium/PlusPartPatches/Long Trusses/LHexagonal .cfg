	@title = Large Wide Hexagonal Truss
	@description = Bogue Requested, YGTE tested, The Large Wide Hegagonal Truss is certainly strange and most certainly, a fun request. We've used some strange methods to strech the part out, so while carrying fuel, it may not be as dense as before, but it certainly looks cool.
